# ✈️ DelayScope: Data-Driven Analysis & Forecasting of U.S. Flight Delays

**DelayScope** is a data mining and statistical learning project developed for the course EAS509 – Statistical Learning and Data Mining II at the University at Buffalo. It aims to uncover patterns in flight delay data and build predictive models using advanced R techniques.

## 📊 Objectives

- Explore delay distributions across airlines, airports, and time
- Use PCA and clustering to identify groups of similar flight delay behaviors
- Forecast future delays using ARIMA models
- Discover delay associations using rule mining
- Deploy insights via an interactive R Shiny dashboard

## 🔧 Methods & Tools

- **Languages**: R
- **Packages**: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `forecast`, `tseries`, `arules`, `shiny`
- **Techniques**: PCA, KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, ARIMA, Association Rules

## 📂 Dataset

- [Flight Delays Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays)
  - `airlines.csv`
  - `airports.csv`
  - `flights.csv`

## 📈 Visualization

Interactive Shiny dashboard featuring:
- Delay heatmaps and trends
- Clustering visualizations
- Forecast plots
